-- Plugging a one-hole context with a binary tree to produce a binary
-- tree is accomplished by the following function
plug :: BinCxt -> Bin -> Bin
plug Hole      t = t
plug (B0 c t2) t = plug c (Node EmptyTile t t2)
plug (B1 t1 c) t = plug c (Node EmptyTile t1 t)

-- A zipper is a pair of a one-hole context c and a tree t, which we
-- think of as defining a pointer to t as a subtree of u = plug c t.
type BinZip = (BinCxt, Bin)
-- (The terminology comes from GÃ©rard Huet's paper, "The Zipper".)

-- The following functions implement moving the pointer up to the
-- left child, up to the right child, or down to the parent of a
-- subtree.  (Note that these operations are only partial, i.e., return a
-- Maybe type, since the subtree may not have a child or a parent.)

go_left (c, Node _ l r) = Just (B0 c r, l)  -- focus on the left child
go_left _ = Nothing            -- (leaf => no left child)

go_right :: BinZip a -> Maybe (BinZip a)
go_right (c, Node _ l r) = Just (B1 l c, r) -- focus on the right child
go_right (c,L _)     = Nothing           -- (leaf => no right child)

go_down :: BinZip a -> Maybe (BinZip a)
go_down (B0 c r, t) = Just (c, Node EmptyTile t r)    -- focus on parent *from* left child
go_down (B1 l c, t) = Just (c, Node EmptyTile l t)    -- focus on parent *from* right child
go_down _ = Nothing            -- (root => no parent)

-- It is also easy to implement operations that perform simple edits,
-- such as say grafting another tree off to the left or right of the
-- the subtree in focus.

graft_left g (c, t) = (c, Node EmptyTile g t)
graft_right :: Bin -> BinZip -> BinZip

-- Finally, we include some pretty-printing routines for binary trees
-- and binary tree zippers.

-- We make use of drawTree :: Tree String -> String from the Data.Tree
-- module, after first defining some conversion routines from Bin's
-- and BinZip's to Tree String's, which also relies on interpreting a
-- BinCxt as a function Tree String -> Tree String.
