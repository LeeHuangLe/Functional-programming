-- Plugging a one-hole context with a binary tree to produce a binary
-- tree is accomplished by the following function
plug :: BinCxt -> Bin -> Bin
plug Hole t              = t
plug (B0 c t1 tile id) t = plug c (N id tile t t1)
plug (B1 t1 c tile id) t = plug c (N id tile t1 t)

-- A zipper is a pair of a one-hole context c and a tree t, which we
-- think of as defining a pointer to t as a subtree of u = plug c t.
type BinZip = (BinCxt, Bin) 

-- (The terminology comes from GÃ©rard Huet's paper, "The Zipper".)

-- The following functions implement moving the pointer up to the
-- left child, up to the right child, or down to the parent of a
-- subtree.  (Note that these operations are only partial, i.e., return a
-- Maybe type, since the subtree may not have a child or a parent.)

-- It is also easy to implement operations that perform simple edits,
-- such as say grafting another tree off to the left or right of the
-- the subtree in focus.

-- Finally, we include some pretty-printing routines for binary trees
-- and binary tree zippers.

-- We make use of drawTree :: Tree String -> String from the Data.Tree
-- module, after first defining some conversion routines from Bin's
-- and BinZip's to Tree String's, which also relies on interpreting a
-- BinCxt as a function Tree String -> Tree String.
